            </h1>

            <p>SpotMe is a mobile-first application developed using React Native to provide a seamless, cross-platform user experience for monitoring real-time parking congestion. The frontend interface, built with React Native and JavaScript, allows users to view current congestion levels, interact with a weekly parking scheduler, and refresh data on-demand. The app's UI was designed to be intuitive and responsive, making it accessible for students and commuters navigating campus parking.</p>
            <p>On the backend, Python was used to implement core logic and API services that communicate with a MongoDB database. Python scripts manage data collection, update congestion statuses, and respond to user-triggered refreshes through HTTP requests. The system uses Flask (or FastAPI if applicable) to expose endpoints for retrieving and modifying parking lot data. MongoDB stores metadata for each parking space, including current congestion ratings, timestamps, and historical patterns.</p>
