                About Me
            </h1>

            <p>Born and raised in Lemoore, California. Currently a senior at California State University, Fresno, pursueing a B.S. in Computer Science and an Advanced Cybersecurity Certification. Passionate about technology and problem-solving, I am a dedicated professional with a strong foundation in software development and cybersecurity. My expertise spans multiple programming languages, including C++, Python, and JavaScript, allowing me to build efficient, secure, and scalable solutions. Additionally, my AWS Cloud Practitioner certification has strengthened my ability to design and implement cloud-based applications with a focus on security best practices. </p>
            <p>With a keen interest in cybersecurity, I enjoy analyzing systems for vulnerabilities, implementing security protocols, and ensuring robust protection against emerging threats. Whether working with network security or encryption methods, I am committed to developing and maintaining secure infrastructures. My experience in cloud security and threat mitigation enables me to approach development with a security-first mindset.</p>
            <p>Beyond technical skills, I thrive in collaborative environments where problem-solving and continuous learning drive innovation. I am always seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge in cybersecurity frameworks, risk management, and defensive security strategies. Staying updated with the latest advancements in cybersecurity is a priority, as I believe strong security is essential to the foundation of any modern system.</p>
            <p>Outside of school, I enjoy refining my technical skills through research and certifications, and engaging with the cybersecurity community. I am always open to new challenges and opportunities to contribute to securing digital landscapes while growing as a professional in the tech industry.</p>
